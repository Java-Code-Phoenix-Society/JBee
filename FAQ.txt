The JBee FAQ

Q: What is JBee?

A: JBee represents an alternative to browsers in order to run 
applets (and applications implemented as applets). JBee caches both 
images and java bytecodes. It will also check for newer versions of 
applets. Changing parameters and applet properties is easily done
in the JBee manager. This version will also let you create 'Applet-
desktops', which mean you may start several applets at once and JBee 
will remember their sizes and positions the next time you start them.

Q: Who is going to use JBee?

A: You and many others who doesn't want to rely on a browser to run 
your favourite java software.

Q: What are the advantages of JBee versus Java-enabled browsers?

A1. A page on a browser is not the right way to run applications. With
JBee on the clients, you deploy your application (as an applet) on a web
server, let the client JBees snoop them up, and then ...GO!. Adjust the 
security settings (from high to medium or low) when you trust the applet 
and want to let it access servers or have access to your printer and disk. 
Se below for details on security.

A2. The new wave of surfing on the internet is here: APPLET-SURFING: discover 
all the weird and fantastic applets deployed on the internet. Try a search for 
'pacman' and see, test and install the results.

Q: How do I use JBee?

A: The 'Start'-button is similar to Windows' Start-menu. Use it to launch applets.
Use JBee Search and Admin to create folders and organize applets as well as install 
applets. The search panel lets you search for applets either by typing in keywords 
or by typing an URL.

Q: Why do JBee crash sometimes and leave applets unaccessible and 'dangling'?

A: Misbehaving applets may cause JBee to crash or create dead threads. 
JBee is not an operating system, all applets share the same JVM.

Q: How do I submit a bug or a feature request?

A: Use the Feedback menu to pop up a feedback dialog. You may also send email 
to feedback@javabee.com.

Q: How is security implemented in JBee?

A: This version of JBee comes with three preinstalled security models:

1 - High security (default) - similar to browsers - very few things allowed
2 - Medium security - printer access allowed
3 - Low security - basically no security with complete disk access and printer access

Contact us if you want details on the security models.

Q: How can I access applets stored on web pages requiring HTTP authentication?

A: The upcoming JBee pro (commercial version) will support this along with other 'pro' features 
(and without any advertisements)


Hope you find JBee useful!
