# JBee 1.0
#### Originally from objectBOX

### What is JBee?
JBee represents an alternative to browsers in order to run applets (and applications implemented as applets).
JBee caches both images and java bytecodes.
It will also check for newer versions of applets.
Changing parameters and applet properties is easily done in the JBee manager.
This version will also let you create 'Applet-desktops', which mean you may start several applets at once and JBee will remember their sizes and positions the next time you start them.

### JCPS Notes:
This app is outside the scope of usual JCPS projects where it needed Java 1.8 to compile and run. 
At this time, it has not been modernised to run on newer JDKs and JREs due to its nature.
